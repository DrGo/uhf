# UHF

Useful helper functions (for Go).

This package is intended for the use of the author
only, and is only open-sourced and on GitHub for
the author's convenience.

You may use this package under the freedoms of the
BSD license.

# Usage

It's probably better to just copy and paste functions out
of this package instead of actually importing the package.

# Purpose 

Nothing in this package is amazing or useful enough to deserve its own real Go package.
They're all useful enough to be needed more than once, but simple enough that it's easy
enough to just recreate them as needed.

The primary purpose of the package is to have these functions in one place so they're
easy to find, so I can re-type them less frequently.
